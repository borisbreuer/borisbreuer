### Hello everyone ðŸ¦„

My name is Boris Breuer. I live in Cologne and I am developing in TypeScript/JavaScript. Sometimes I write a bit PHP as well.

I use Vue.js with its ecosystem for my frontend stuff. node.js with express.js etc. for my backend. And MySQL as my database. I use docker for development purposes.
 
In my spare time I try to make some procedural art with processing or p5.js
