### Hello everyone ðŸ¦„

My name is Boris Breuer. I live in Cologne and I am developing in JavaScript. Sometimes I write a bit PHP as well.

I use Vue.js with its ecosystem for my frontend stuff. node.js with express.js and other npm packages for my backend. And MySQL as my database. I use docker for development purposes.
